// the messages parsed from bytes appended since the last read. Modeled on the
// incremental byte-offset read in codex-usage/scanner.ts (parseCodexUsageFile's
// skipInitialBytes), but specialized to the NativeChatMessage record decoders.
//
// Teardown discipline (plan U4 risk: file-watch fd leaks): every subscription
// owns exactly one fs.FSWatcher and one debounce timer. unsubscribe() closes
// the watcher and clears the timer synchronously, and the module tracks the live
// watcher count so tests can assert no watcher survives teardown.
