/**
 * Which kind of worker `orchestration.workerStart` starts, decided from the user's own settings.
 *
 * There is no `--structured` flag: if the user's default is that a new agent tab opens as a
 * structured native chat, an orchestration worker is one too. That default is a preference, not a
 * demand, so a dispatch it cannot apply to falls back to an ordinary PTY terminal worker and the
 * receipt says which mode ran and why — a routine `worker-start` must never fail because the user
 * happens to have a chat preference on.
 *
 * The settings default and the per-launch feasibility both come from
 * `shared/structured-native-chat-launch-route`, the same module the renderer's
 * `resolveAgentLaunchRoute` uses; only the placement options that exist solely on this command are
 * decided here.
