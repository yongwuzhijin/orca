/**
 * Force the renderer to recompute its viewport without touching the native window frame.
 *
 * Why: `webContents.invalidate()` repaints but never reflows, so a stale `dvh` root keeps the
 * status bar clipped off-screen (STA-2383). The frame jiggle that used to fix that mutates
 * NSWindow, which self-deadlocks the main thread on macOS 26's scene-backed windows. Device
 * emulation drives the same resize through the compositor instead — real reflow, no scene update.
 *
 * Why scale factor and not a +1px viewport: a one-pixel height delta changes the CSS box, so a
 * terminal sitting just under an xterm row boundary gains a row, and the pane fit observer reads
 * that transient grid as stable and forwards a real PTY resize — then reverses it on restore.
 * Measured 3/54 window heights SIGWINCHing twice per reveal. A scale-factor delta re-runs layout
 * with byte-identical CSS geometry: 0/54, with no WebGL atlas rebuild or context loss.
