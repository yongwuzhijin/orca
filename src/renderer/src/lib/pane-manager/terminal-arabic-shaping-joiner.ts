// run into one cell range makes both renderers (WebGL atlas, DOM row factory)
// draw the run as a single string, letting the browser apply contextual
// shaping and BiDi ordering inside the run's grid-aligned cell box. The
// terminal buffer and PTY stream are untouched, and xterm itself un-joins any
// range that holds the cursor or a partially selected span, so cursor

 * Character-joiner handler for xterm's registerCharacterJoiner API. Receives

 * cluster, tunneling through neutral characters between RTL words. Runs with
 * fewer than two RTL code points are skipped: an isolated Arabic letter
 * already renders in its correct (isolated) form cell-by-cell.
 *
 * Known upstream limitation (affects every joiner, ligatures too): a
 * standalone width-0 cell (e.g. RLM at line start) makes xterm's
 * CharacterJoinerService skip the cell without advancing its string index,
 * shifting the run's cell range by one — fix belongs upstream in xterm.js.
 *
 * Known upstream limitation #2: the WebGL renderer un-joins a range for the
 * cursor or a partial selection but not for decorations, so a search-match
 * highlight inside a joined run renders all-or-nothing — the whole run when
 * the match covers the run's first cell, otherwise not at all. Same class as
 * ligatures today, extended here to phrase-length runs.
